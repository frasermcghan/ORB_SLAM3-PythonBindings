# ORB_SLAM3-PythonBindings
A python wrapper for my fork of ORB_SLAM3, which can be found at [https://github.com/frasermcghan/ORB_SLAM3](https://github.com/frasermcghan/ORB_SLAM3).

**Much of the code in this repository has been taken from the ORB_SLAM2-PythonBindings [https://github.com/jskinn/ORB_SLAM2-PythonBindings](https://github.com/jskinn/ORB_SLAM2-PythonBindings), with modifications made to work with ORB_SLAM3.**

## Installation
Installation with docker is **strongly recommended** to avoid issues. If you prefer manually installing, all the dependencies and installation steps are listed in the Dockerfile. This code has been tested on **Ubuntu 16.04**.
